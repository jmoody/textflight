## SECTION 07: REPUTATION

By default, you have zero reputation with all other operators and factions, and they have zero reputation with you. Having negative reputation will cause your structures to automatically fire upon each other, and having positive reputation will allow them to dock.

You lose reputation with someone any time you fire upon, destroy, or capture their structures.

The `rep` command allows you to set the reputation of another operator, and the `repf` command allows you to set the reputation of another faction.

The `faction_rep` and `faction_repf` commands behave the same way, except they affect your faction's reputations instead of your personal reputations.
