## SECTION 05: COMMUNICATION

Operators can be messaged using the `subs` command to send a subspace message directly to their session, or the `fact` command which sends a subspace message to all operators in your faction. Structures can be communicated with using the `hail` command, or `locl` to hail every structure in the system with the same message. Structures not located in the same system as you cannot be hailed.

Messages are displayed when you run any command. You can restrict what messages you receive using the `chat` command. A setting of zero disables all messages, 1 or more allows `hail` and `subs`, 2 or more allows `locl` and `fact`, and 3 allows all messages, including `glob`. If your account has been marked with premium status, you can use format codes in your message. The following codes are available:

- `^0`: Clear formatting.
- `^1`: Set text colour to red.
- `^2`: Set text colour to green.
- `^3`: Set text colour to yellow.
- `^4`: Set text colour to blue.
- `^5`: Set text colour to cyan.
- `^6`: Set text colour to pink.
- `^7`: Set text colour to white.
- `^8`: Set text colour to black.
