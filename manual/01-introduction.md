## SECTION 01: INTRODUCTION

The universe is vast, and bountiful. It is also home to countless other operators, like yourself, many of which are hostile. At first things can seem overwhelming, but persevere and your fleet will grow. Here are some tasks which will set you in the right direction, which you can learn more about by reading the rest of this manual:

1. Explore the nearby area for resources.
2. Produce more fuel for your fusion reactor.
3. Locate an uninhabited system and establish a planetary base.
4. Construct a new, larger ship equipped with better outfits.
5. Establish a colony and join a faction

The interface language can be changed using the `language` command. The account username and password can be changed using the `username` and `password` commands, and optionally an email address can be attached using the `email` command in case you ever need to reset your password.

Every day you log in, your login streak will increase. Forgetting to log in for a day will result in your streak being reset to zero. Every day, you will receive one crate with a quality corresponding to your login streak, which can be opened using the `crate` command. Crates contain a random number of items, or a single outfit of a random mark. Higher quality crates contain more items and larger outfits.

If you have a premium key and would like to redeem it, use the `redeem` command. This will consume the key and permanently upgrade your account to premium status. Currently, the only function of premium is to grant the usage of colour codes in your chat messages. See [SECTION 05: COMMUNICATION](#section-05-communication) for more information.

Many of the commands available in game are not documented in this manual; use the `help` command to get a list of all commands and their usage.
