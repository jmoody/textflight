## SECTION 01: INTRODUCTION

The universe is vast, and bountiful. It is also home to countless other operators, like yourself, many of which are hostile. At first things can seem overwhelming, but persevere and your fleet will grow. Here are some tasks which will set you in the right direction, which you can learn more about by reading the rest of this manual:

1. Explore the nearby area for resources.
2. Produce more fuel for your fusion reactor.
3. Locate an uninhabited system and establish a planetary base.
4. Construct a new, larger ship equipped with better outfits.

The interface language can be changed using the `language` command. The account username and password can be changed using the `username` and `password` commands, and optionally an email address can be attached using the `email` command in case you ever need to reset your password. The `chat` command can be used to toggle on or off the display of messages sent by other operators, which can be useful when trying to filter profanity from a broadcast. Finally, the `help` command can be used to list all available commands and their descriptions.
